Among basketball leagues I consider NBA to be most fascinating and my two favorite players are [Russel Westbrook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l3txhX0L4) and [Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f6TnC0xFPY) <i className=\"fa fa-basketball-ball\"></i>. As a former sprinter I am still shocked by Wayde van Niekerk's [world record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG91krXuxyw)."

Aside from that, in my free time I like visiting escape rooms and reading books <i className=\"fa fa-book\"></i> (particularly fantasy and history). However my most beloved activity is going to rock concerts (I've been to around 40 already)."
