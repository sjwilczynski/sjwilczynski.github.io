The collaboration with University of Angers aimed at extending the method to work with data from zero inflated negative binomial distribution and proving mathematical properties of MLCC and PEnalized SEmi-integrated Likelihood (PESEL) method. Furthermore, we use MLCC to extract significant features/information from huge genetic dataset (1200 observations, 60000 variables)."

I was responsible for formalizing its mathematical basis, maintaining and extending R package [Varclust](https://github.com/psobczyk/varclust) that includes MLCC. Moreover, I made and analysed simulations to justify that MLCC is competitive with state-of-the-art variable clustering methods."
