Apart from my work, I enjoy doing and watching
various sports, especially basketball, athletics and swimming. Among
basketball leagues I consider NBA to be most fascinating and my two favorite
players are [Russel Westbrook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3l3txhX0L4)
and [Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f6TnC0xFPY) <Icon name="fa-solid:basketball-ball" class="basketball-ball-icon"  />. As a former sprinter I am still amazed by [Wayde van Niekerk's world
record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG91krXuxyw). I love learning about history and society, here are some of my favorites books, channels and podcasts:

As for my other interests, I am keen on travelling <Icon name="fa:plane" class="icon"/>
(most beautiful city - Porto, Portugal, most astonishing view - Tatev, Armenia,
best beach - Tangalle, Sri Lanka). In my free time I like visiting [escape rooms](https://lock.me/pl/user/46896/stanislaw-w-1)
and reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100417409-stanis-aw-wilczy-ski) <Icon name="fa:book" class="book-icon" />. However, my most beloved activity is
going to rock concerts.

I am also an avid fan of the [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) and a follower of
[Factfulness idea](https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/).
