# Responsive CV in React

The project is based on [startboootstrap-resume](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume).
I rewrote it in React to follow the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) rule: reduce amount of HTML and CSS code by using of React's reusable components. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

To start using this for your own needs:

* clone the repository
* go to its directory and install all dependencies: `npm install --no-optional`
* start the app using `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view your changes.

### Deploying to github pages

If you want just like me to publish your CV using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) you should follow the steps 
described [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) and [here](https://dev.to/javascripterika/deploy-a-react-app-as-a-github-user-page-with-yarn-3fka).
Take caution as the steps depend on whether you use your [username.github.io]() repository or a different one.
